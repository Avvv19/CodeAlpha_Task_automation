# CodeAlpha_Task_automation
The Python script developed for the task automation project effectively addresses the challenge of file organization by automating the sorting of files based on their extensions.
This script enhances productivity and organization by systematically moving files into designated folders, each labeled according to file type. 
By utilizing Python's built-in libraries like `os` for interacting with the operating system and `shutil` for performing file operations, 
the script efficiently scans a specified directory,identifies file types, and sorts them accordingly.
The script is designed to be user-friendly and easily adaptable, requiring minimal input from the userâ€”just the path to the directory containing the files to be organized. 
Through the use of conditional statements and loops, it checks for the existence of target folders and creates them if they are not present, 
ensuring that each file is moved to its appropriate location without duplication or errors. 
This automation not only saves time but also reduces the potential for manual errors, promoting a cleaner and more organized digital workspace.
This project is a practical application of Python for real-world tasks, demonstrating the power of scripting to streamline repetitive tasks in file management.
It showcases essential programming concepts such as file handling, directory manipulation, and automated system tasks, making 
it an excellent example of using programming to enhance efficiency in everyday computing tasks.
